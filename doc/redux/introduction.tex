explore rich space of algebraic path finding.
Very difficult.


\begin{itemize}
\item Unlike the metarouting of~\cite{griffin05metarouting},
      the CAS system has be implemented in the language OCaml. 
\item The correctness of the CAS implementation has been
  fully verified with a theorem proving system (Coq).
\item The set of algebraic combinators is richer than~\cite{griffin05metarouting}.
\item users of the OCaml-CAS need only download and compile the OCaml code,
  there is no need to learn Coq or download the proofs.
\item guarded algorithms.   
\end{itemize}

Not currently hooked into distributed routing. 

We hope the this will be a contribution to the routing communtity.

\subsection{Theorems for free}


\begin{itemize}
\item CAS not bases on sufficient conditions. but decidiblitly 
\item explain extraction 
\item Coq theorems cover hundreds of of results that are scattered in
  dozens of papers and books.
  These have been implemented in Coq and integrated into a usale system
  where users can exploit these results without effort --- they have been
  baked into the combinators! 
\end{itemize}
