Let $(S,\ \bullet)$ and $(T,\ \diamond)$ be semigroups.

The {direct product} is denoted 
\[ 
   (S,\ \bullet) \times (T,\ \diamond) \equiv (S \times T,\ \star)
\] 
where 
\[ 
\star = \bullet \times \diamond 
\] 
is defined as 
\[ 
	(s_1,\ t_1) \star (s_2,\ t_2) 
        = 
        (s_1 \bullet s_2,\  t_1 \diamond t_2).
\]
