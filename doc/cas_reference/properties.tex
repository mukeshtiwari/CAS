There are two types of properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first set of properties are those required for various convergence proofs for the algebras.
\item  To fully close the theorems about the first set of properties with necessary and sufficient conditions, we also need to track a second additional set of properties.  We call these \emph{closure} properties.
\end{enumerate}
